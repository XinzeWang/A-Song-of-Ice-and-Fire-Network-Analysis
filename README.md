# A-Song-of-Ice-And-Fire-Network-Analysis
character co-occurrence network and its evolution in the books

Data used in the project is from https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf. The networks(nodes and edges) were created by connecting two characters whenever their names (or nicknames) appeared within 15 words of one another in one of the books in "A Song of Ice and Fire." The edge weight corresponds to the number of interactions.
